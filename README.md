# What is a Car Worth?

### Description
This project was designed to provide more practice using linear and polynomial regressions.  The data was read in from the included file, and included information about the price, mileage, and other information about each car.  The following tasks were completed in a Jupyter Notebook:

* Finding the linear regression equation for mileage vs. price
* Charting any data that proves useful
* Determining whether the regression equation is a good fit for the data using the R<sup>2</sup> score
* Finding the best combination of factors to predict price
* Experimenting with dummy variables
